CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION USING GAUSSIAN MIXTURE MODEL

In today's competitive business landscape, understanding customer pattern is important
for analyzing marketing strategies and services. Customer segmentation, the process of
categorizing customers into well defined groups based on resemblance in their characteristics,
preferences, and behaviors, plays a key role in achieving these objectives. This research
proposes the application of Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) as a effective tool for customer
segmentation. GMMs, a probabilistic model, offer a flexible framework for fetching the
complex and often multimodal nature of customer data. The model assumes that the data is
produced from a mix of several Gaussian distributions, allowing it to identify latent patterns
and connections within the dataset. This research leverages the GMM's ability to model both
the mean and covariance structure of the data, providing a more accurate representation of
customer segments. The process involves preprocessing customer data, including demographic
information, purchase records, and behavioral characteristics. Then GMM is used to the
processed data to identify uncovered patterns and sort customers into various segments. The
model variables are enhanced using Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, which
provides robust convergence and accurate segmentation.
